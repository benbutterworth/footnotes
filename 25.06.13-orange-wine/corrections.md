# Corrections
> Since this article was first published, some elements of this article have been pointed out as inaccurate or incorrect. I've updated the published article with any necessary corrections and this document details the exact changes. 

## Terminology
1. The word "brewing" has been changed to fermentation when referring to the process of making wine.
2. "Wine brewers" has been changed to "wine makers".
3. For correctness, "To make orange wine, however, the grape juice and pulp aren’t separated right away and are left **alone** to **infuse** for days, even weeks." has been changed to "To make orange wine, however, the grape juice and pulp aren’t separated right away and are left **together** to **macerate** for days, even weeks".

## Quote
On his suggestion, I have added to Nick from DBM Wine's quote "They're really food wines", so the quote now reads "They're really **good** food wines". The initial quotation remains accurate but was not given sufficient context; this change is intended to make clear that orange wines are not *only* for food.
