I wrote this article after attending a wine tasting "Orange is the new white" at DBM wines in Clifton, Bristol. I am a customer there, but wrote this article unprompted of my own volition and did not receive any form of compensation for writing it. They did request that I link to their social media in this article as they are trying to improve their Instagram traffic. I have done so in a way I believe makes clear this article is not an endorsement or advertisement. 

I would like to thank Lisa, Andrea and Nick from DBM wines for sharing their time and expertise with me!
