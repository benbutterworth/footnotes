# Footnotes
**"chatgpt.com is currently the 6th most visited website in the world..."** - I couldn't find official OpenAI usage statistics, so I looked at 3rd party website usage trackers \[1\] and \[2\]. 

**"OpenAI's Data Processing Addendum, released February 2025..."** - OpenAI's Data Processing Addendum is a big document \[3\] but is unambiguous in its stance towards selling user data. Initially, I wanted to figure out the extent to which user prompts could be used to train future OpenAI models, but I could not find a satisfactory answer with a degree of certainty and chose to focus elsewhere.

**"IBM's granite, built specifically for problem solving..."** - See \[4\].

**"Meta's codellama, designed to write and discuss code."** - See \[5\].

**"Even a small LLM will take up at least..."** - This statement is based on the shortlist of the most popular models ranked in \[6\] and *not* an exhaustive search of available models. 

**"then open up a terminal and type `ollama run MODEL_NAME` to download your first, offline large language model"** - I learnt how to use Ollama from Tech with Tim's video \[7\] demonstration.
